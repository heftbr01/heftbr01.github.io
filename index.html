<p>I am a an older brother, a runner, and a bookworm. I run Cross Country and Track for Luther College and 
enjoy running the farthest event I can, which has been the 8k. I hope for the opportunity to run the 10k at the end of the Cross 
Country season as well as during Track. I am also a fan of fantasy books and will read them voraciously, plowing through the 
entirety of a book in a single day if I find it interesting.</p>
