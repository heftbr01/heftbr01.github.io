<h3>Running</h3>
<p>I am a runner, a long distance runner. Few things bring me more
joy than to be able to go out for a run and feel like I hit my stride
and got my pace stable. At the same time however, I'm quite injury prone.
ever since my freshman year of track in highschool, I've had some
sort of injury at least once each season (Cross Country and Track).
This constant struggle with being injured has made me take my stretching
and strengthening exercises seriously and there's always something
throughout the day that I can do to prevent injury or deal with injury.</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>Reading is a passion of mine, something that I feel compelled to do each and every day.
Once I start reading, I become immersed in the text, not paying any
sort of attention to my surroundings. If a book is good enough, I can and
will accidently tune out everything around me, my body going
on autopilot to respond to conversation with "Uh huh" and "Yep".
I'll even read ahead in books for class if I find the information
interesting enough--which isn't always beneficial, because when the rest of the 
class gets to it, I've forgotten some of it. Probably not as much as 
others would have forgotten either, though. I tend to retain information
that I read quite well, but that tends to be equalized out by my short-term memory
not being great.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>My need to read naurally leads to this next characteristic. I like to write and I know
how to write because of all the reading that I've done. The problem 
here is that I'm never quite satisfied with what I've written 
because a small part of me looks at my writing and says "Hey, this doesn't 
sound quite right. Do something to fix it." Once I begin attmpting 
to fix it, however, that same part of me will pipe up and say "Okay, that part sounds better now, 
but it could still use some work. The bigger problem is that nothing else 
matches that section. Blend the stuff before and after that section 
to match it please." It's a never-ending cycle, which makes me 
reluctant to edit anything before I've written it all down. I'm still 
in the process of learning how to get myself to edit my writing 
after I finish something because the lazy part of me says "Eh, good enough as is." 
And I know it's not.</p>
